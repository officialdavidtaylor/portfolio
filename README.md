## Tech Stack

- **PNPM Workspaces** -> monorepo for ease of deploying my site and sanity studio separately

- **Astro** -> using TypeScript, of course
- **Tailwindcss** -> because it just clicks in my brain somehow

Coming soon:

- **Sanity CMS** -> a headless wonder
- **React** -> the framework I'm most proficient with

Maybe in the future?:

- **Three.js** -> idk if I'm smart enough, but it would be sick
